<h1>You found this note on the moon: </h1>
    <h2> <a href="Page8.html">"The moon is not at all what I expected. Firstly, there are signs of life that are not human: alien life is here and so far it has been friendly. The aliens have boarded the space craft and have been curiously touching all of the space equipment, speaking in a foreign language about the technology. Probably about how under developed it is compared to theirs. I wonder if they are able to harvest the energy from black holes yet or move through space faster than the speed of light. So many questions but it is very difficult to communicate with them.&nbsp;</a></h2>
	 <h2><a href="Page7.html">Secondly, I feel as though I have encountered a ghost here on the moon, maybe one from a past astronaut who did not make it. It follows me around the moon as I am collecting samples and setting up my lab. It seems very interested in what I am doing, maybe it knows more than I think... The ghost makes strange noises at night and it wakes me up at around 3 am every morning. I am not sure if the ghost is as friendly as the alien life I have come across. I fear I might not make it..."</a></h2>
